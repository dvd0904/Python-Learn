*Day 2
- dir(str) in python console list all method can be used with string or can use help(str) to list all method and its capabilities
- similar with list,...
- import builtins and dir(builtins) to list all method of python can be accessed directly without dot (.)

*Day3
- Math-case available in python 3.10

*Day4
- "_" in match-case mean default
- In python, it's is not possible to add a number with a string but it's possible to multiply a number with a string:
+ Ex: 'a' * 3 = 'aaa'
+ Ex: 'Hi' * 3 = 'HiHiHi'
- Can not write a number to a text file, have to convert it to a string and then write
- Replace method return a new string
- Strings are immutable => strings don't support item assignment => can not be changed
+ Ex: filename = "dai"; filename[1] = 'x' => error
- List is mutable and tuple is immutable

*Day5
- Enumerate function show not only the item of list, but also the index of that list
- F string (format string)
- Stupid python: 
Eg:
    for index, item in enumerate(todos):
        row = f"{index + 1}-{item}"
        print(row)
    print(index, item)
Different with C or C++, outside of for loop, index and item can be used with the last value of them after a for loop
- Enumerate function return an Enumerate object, python can not display it => can visualize it by using list
Eg: a = enumerate(["a", "b"])
list(a)
- sort method does not return anything, default is ascending order, if sort descending
Eg: list.sort(reverse=True) #sort descending
